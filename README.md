## Mathematical Concepts for Deep Learning 1 (AASD4011, Winter 2023)
Welcome to the AASD4011 Repository for the Winter 2023 semester. 
This repository contains notebooks for the course, organized into modules and placed in separate folders. The module folders are numbered in the order that they will be followed. Modules will be added as course progresses.

### Setup
To run the code on your own machine, rather than using a managed notebook service like Colab, you will need to set up a development environment. Many tech companies expect their ML and DL engineers to have some experience working with development environments, so it is beneficial to gain this skill beforehand.

**To set up the development environment on a local or remote machine, please follow the instructions in the setup folder's README.md file.**

### Creating your Own Personal Workspace
To maximize your learning, it is recommended that you actively engage with the notebooks by running them, modifying them, and adding your own comments or improvements. You can create a personal workspace within this repository by creating a branch and pushing it to GitHub (using the command `git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME`). In this branch, you can freely modify, add, or delete files as needed. It is a good idea to name the branch with your student ID as a prefix, for example `01234-week1-lecture1` (`0124` being the student ID). You can create as many branches as you wish.

Another option for creating a personal workspace is to fork this repository. This is a good option, but if you are not familiar with working with forks, including syncing them with the upstream repository, it may be a more advanced option than using branches. Additionally, it is less commonly used in the industry.

### Contribution to `main`
While not required, we welcome contributions to the main branch. This could include suggestions for fixing typos or bugs, improving the code, or adding helpful explanations and comments. Please note that any contributions to the main branch will be subject to the repository's license, which allows for the use of the content as open-source material. While these contributions are appreciated and can make the repository's educational content better for all users, they are not a requirement for the course and will not impact your grade. If you wish to contribute, you can create a branch in this repository, make your modifications, and submit a pull request. This will be highly appreciated. 

### Feel confident to play around - you can't break anything :)
 The main branch is protected, so you can feel free to play around without worrying about breaking anything for others. main is protected through the following measures:
* Modifications to `main` must be made through a Pull Request (direct commits to `main` are blocked by Github).
* The Pull Request must be approved by a code owner, who is one of the course instructors (listed in the CODEOWNERS file)."
